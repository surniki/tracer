Implement the logic for converting the traces into cubic bezier curves.

Add command line arguments for tracing multiple colors.

Add command line argument for having the tracer "wear a hat" of variable size.
Currently, the tracer only checks to see if there is one "white" pixel to its
right, "north" right, and "south" right. Make it so that more pixels can be
checked in order to cases like the left interior corner of the 'A'.
